### What is PGP / OpenPGP / GPG?

In general, the terms GPG (GNU Privacy Guard), OpenPGP and PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) are used interchangeably. 
Technically, OpenPGP is the encryption standard, and GPG is an implementation of that standard.
PGPro provides an interface to an OpenPGP implementation.

### Where are my keys stored?

All keys in PGPro are stored locally using Apple\'s native Core Data framework. 
Therefore the keys are stored encrypted and on your device only.

Note: This also means that they are not included in your iCloud backup.
